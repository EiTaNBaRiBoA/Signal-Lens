# Signal Lens

Signal Lens is a plugin for Godot 4.3. 

It is a visual debugger for signal connections.
Given any node in a remote scene, it will render a graph with all the connections to that node's signals.
It doesn't matter if that node is an autoload, or if the signal's are built-in, or custom made - Signal Lens will draw it all when given the node's global path in the remote.

7. Click a signal or a callable inside a node to highlight its specific connections.

The rendered graph will display all the target node's signals, be them custom or built-in. 
They will be connected to other nodes that represent other objects in the scene tree, pointing their exact callable signature.
